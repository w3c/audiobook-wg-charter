# Proposed Charter for an Audiobooks Maintenance Working Group

Any text in this repository should be considered as a draft. The goal is to submit it, at some point, to the W3C Advisory Committee for approval.

The proposed maintenance Working Group should serve as a follow up of the current [Publishing  Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/04/publ-wg-charter/) whose charter expires in June 2020.

The [properly rendered version](https://w3c.github.io/audiobooks-wg-charter/) is also available.
